class VAE_AttentionBlock(nn.Module):
    """
    A custom attention block for Variational Autoencoders (VAE) that integrates
    Group Normalization and Self-Attention mechanisms. This block takes feature
    maps from a VAE encoder or decoder and applies attention to enhance the representation
    by capturing long-range dependencies between pixels.

    Args:
        channels (int): The number of input feature channels.

    Layers:
        groupnorm (nn.GroupNorm): Group normalization layer applied to the input tensor.
        attention (SelfAttention): Self-attention layer that applies attention across the spatial dimensions.

    Forward Pass:
        - Input: A 4D tensor of shape (Batch_Size, Features, Height, Width).
        - Group normalization is applied to the input tensor.
        - The input tensor is reshaped and transposed to perform self-attention on the spatial dimensions.
        - The attention output is reshaped back and combined with the original input (residual connection).
        - The resulting tensor of shape (Batch_Size, Features, Height, Width) is returned.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The output tensor after applying group normalization, self-attention, and residual connection.
